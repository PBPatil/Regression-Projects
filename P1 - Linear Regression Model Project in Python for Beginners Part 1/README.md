<H3> <u> Aim </u></H3>
To give a gentle introduction to the fundamentals of regression and build a simple linear
regression model in python.
Data Description
The dataset used is the soccer player dataset. It has information about various players
from different clubs, and it provides data over ten features with a number of goals as the
target variable.

<H3> Tech Stack </H3>

➔ Language: Python <br/>
➔ Libraries: pandas, statsmodel, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn, scipy <br/>


<H3> Approach </H3>
This project starts with a real-life example for regression analysis, with an introduction to
simple and multiple linear regression. Building the statistical foundation for the
regression, it gives you a brief idea of the formula of regression. With this background,
the first regression model in python is built. Going through the interpolation and
extrapolation also explains errors in regression and Lurking variables. The point
estimators of mean and variance and distributions of underlying parameters are also
discussed. The coefficient of determination is also known, and R squared is briefly
explained. The project ends with diagnostics and remedial measures for regression with
a practical explanation.
